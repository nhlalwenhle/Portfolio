					<p> I come from an accounting background, i was a 3rd year BCom Accounting student at The University of Johannesburg with Two remaining subjects before dropping out due to financial constraints.         Many junior data scientists I know (this includes myself) wanted to get into data science because it was all about solving complex problems with cool new machine learning algorithms that make huge impact on a business. One of the most important skills needed to work as a Data Scientist is communication. You need to be able to explain complex technical concepts to many different audiences and to be able to tell stories with data. At work I might have to explain how a machine learning model works at many different levels, from fellow data scientists to a business sponsor, or executive, who has no technical knowledge of the process.</p>

					<p>My job is to work with people in the business to help answer their questions, find use from their data and build my skills as a data scientist.</p>

					<p>I have largely studied data science through self led learning so I have not necessarily had alot of teachers to ask questions to or to check that my understanding is in fact correct. The internet, however, is a great place to get feedback.</p>
